                <h1>One of the architecture of the Indian Constitution</h1>
                <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist,
                     social reformer and political leader who headed the  committee drafting the Constitution of India 
                    from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, 
                    and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.In 1947 Ambedkar became the law minister of the government of India. 
                    He took a leading part in the framing of the Indian constitution, outlawing discrimination against untouchables, and skillfully helped to 
                    steer it through the assembly. He resigned in 1951, disappointed at his lack of influence in the government. In October 1956, in despair 
                    because of the perpetuation of untouchability in Hindu doctrine, he renounced Hinduism and became a Buddhist, together with about 200,000 
                    fellow Dalits, at a ceremony in Nagpur. Ambedkar’s book The Buddha and His Dhamma appeared posthumously in 1957, and it was republished 
                    as The Buddha and His Dhamma.Born of a Dalit Mahar family of western India, he was as a boy humiliated by his high-caste 
                    schoolfellows. His father was an officer in the Indian army. Awarded a scholarship by the Gaekwar (ruler) 
                    of Baroda (now Vadodara), he studied at universities in the United States, Britain, and Germany. He entered the Baroda Public 
                    Service at the Gaekwar’s request, but, again ill-treated by his high-caste colleagues, he turned to legal practice and to 
                    teaching. He soon established his leadership among Dalits, founded several journals on their behalf, and succeeded in 
                    obtaining special representation for them in the legislative councils of the government. Contesting Mahatma Gandhi’s 
                    claim to speak for Dalits (or Harijans, as Gandhi called them), he wrote What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the 
                    Untouchables (1945).
